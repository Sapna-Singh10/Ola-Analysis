# Ola Ride Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of Ola ride data, involving data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using various tools and technologies. The objective of this project is to derive insights from ride data to optimize operational efficiency and enhance decision-making.

## Repository Contents
- **CSV File**: Contains the raw ride data used for analysis.
- **SQL Files**: Includes scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and querying the dataset.
- **Python File**: Utilized for additional data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Power BI File**: A dashboard presenting key insights and trends from the ride data.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Power BI**: Interactive data visualization and reporting.

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Collection**: Obtained ride data in CSV format.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Used SQL and Python to remove inconsistencies and prepare the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends and patterns in ride data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards using Power BI.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sapna-Singh10/Ola-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the SQL files and run them on a database platform (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server) to clean and process the data.
3. Use the Python script to perform additional data analysis.
4. Load the Power BI file to explore visualizations and insights.

## Insights Gained
- Identification of peak ride hours.
- Customer behavior and preferences.
- Trends in fare prices and ride demand.
- Geographical distribution of rides.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of machine learning models to predict ride demand.
- Addition of more data sources for a comprehensive analysis.
